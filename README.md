# MakeAGroceryList (In Development)
A website for automatically making grocery lists from online recipes

### Description

This website was created because I wanted an interactive and easy way to get the ingredients from a webpage into a list to go grocery shopping. This website will scrape a url that it is given and populate a list of ingredients. These ingredients can be moved and marked off as either bought or used. This website is meant to be useful for making grocery lists and marking off what has been purchased. It is also helpful for cooking by allowing one to mark off what ingredients have already been used in the recipe.

### Features Already Completed
1. One can enter a url and the website will get the ingredients from that website and populate it into a list. This currently only works for websites that mark their ingredients with an html tag.
2. The ingredients can be reorganized by clicking and dragging them.
3. The ingredients can be clicked and they will be moved into a different column and marked green
4. Ingredients can also be deleted
5. Ingredients are saved in a recipe that can be reused
6. Recipes can be added one after another

### Future Feature List
1. Make ingredients list editable
2. Convert all recipes on page into one to make a grocery list
3. Add ability to delete and update recipes
4. Make measurements add together for the same ingredients from different recipes
